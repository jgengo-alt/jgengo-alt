Hi 👋, I’m @jgengo-alt 

It is just my alt account. You can find my my official Github <a href='https://github.com/jgengo'>here</a>

I'm trying to open myself to other topics I usually reject as: frontend or javascript 👀 but I don't want to polluate my principal account with unappealing repositories that I won't take good care of 🐱
